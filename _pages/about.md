I am a Research Scientist in the Atmospheric Science Department at Colorado State University. I work with [Dr. Jeff Pierce](https://pierce.atmos.colostate.edu/) and [Dr. Emily Fischer](https://sites.google.com/rams.colostate.edu/fischer-group/), and my research interests revolve around linking satellite observations to surface air quality (with the help of atmospheric models). I also work on intersiciplinary projects that focus on community air monitoring, the health impacts of exposure to poor air quality, and how we communicate about air quality. I received both my MS and PhD from CSU working with [Dr. Colette Heald](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/).
