I am currently a Research Scientist in the National Park Service Group at CIRA at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO. I do data analysis and QA/QC for the [IMPROVE Network](https://vista.cira.colostate.edu/Improve/improve-program/). I was previously a Research Scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at CSU where I also received my MS and PhD working with [Dr. Colette Heald](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/).
